# Coronal Holes & High-Speed Streams (HSS)
One-sentence takeaway: Dark EUV regions with open magnetic fields emit fast solar wind that can trigger recurrent geomagnetic activity as the Sun rotates.

What it is:
Coronal holes are areas of low-density, open-field corona. They are sources of high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) that co-rotate with the Sun.

How it works:
Open field lines allow plasma to escape more freely, creating fast streams. Where fast wind overtakes slow wind, co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) form and can enhance geomagnetic activity when they reach Earth.

Key terms:
HSS; CIR; Co-rotation; EUV dark regions.

Typical values/units:
HSS speeds commonly 500–800 km·s⁻¹ versus ambient ~300–400 km·s⁻¹.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
EUV imagery showing coronal holes; predicted HSS arrival windows; Kp increases in recurrent patterns (~27‑day cadence).

Common misconceptions:
“Coronal holes are holes in the Sun.” They are magnetically open, not physical cavities.
