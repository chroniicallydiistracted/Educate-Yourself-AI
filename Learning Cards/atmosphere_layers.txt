# Layers of Earth’s Atmosphere
One-sentence takeaway: The atmosphere is stratified by temperature structure and composition, each layer with distinct phenomena.

What it is:
Troposphere (weather), Stratosphere (ozone), Mesosphere (meteors), Thermosphere (aurora, ionosphere), Exosphere (outer transition).

How it works:
Temperature decreases with height in the troposphere, increases in the stratosphere due to ozone absorption, decreases again in the mesosphere, and increases in the thermosphere due to absorption of high-energy radiation.

Key terms:
Tropopause; Ozone layer; Ionosphere.

Typical values/units:
Troposphere depth ~8–15 km; stratosphere to ~50 km; mesosphere ~50–85 km; thermosphere above.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
• Weather radars/satellites mostly sense troposphere/low stratosphere.
• Auroral/space-weather layers correspond to thermosphere/ionosphere.

Common misconceptions:
“All clouds are low.” Deep convection can penetrate near the tropopause.
