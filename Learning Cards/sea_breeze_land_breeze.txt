# Sea-Breeze & Land-Breeze Circulations
One-sentence takeaway: Daily coast-parallel circulations form from differential heating between land and water, focusing storms along boundaries.

What it is:
Thermally driven mesoscale breezes.

How it works:
Daytime: onshore sea breeze with inland convergence; nighttime: reverse land breeze; boundaries trigger convection where they collide with other flows.

Key terms:
Convergence line; Collision boundary; Mesoscale.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Fine cloud lines in visible imagery; radar convergence boundaries; afternoon storms near coasts.

Common misconceptions:
“Sea breezes only cool.” They can also trigger strong storms.
