# Zodiacal Light & Ecliptic Geometry
One-sentence takeaway: Sunlight scattering off interplanetary dust creates a faint cone along the ecliptic, best seen in dark, clear skies.

What it is:
A diffuse night-sky glow aligned with the ecliptic plane; the gegenschein is an antisolar brightening.

How it works:
Forward scattering by dust grains enhances brightness near the Sun’s direction after dusk/before dawn; geometry with the ecliptic controls visibility by season and latitude.

Key terms:
Ecliptic plane; Elongation; Gegenschein.

Typical values/units:
Surface brightness in mag·arcsec⁻² (faint; easily drowned by light pollution or moonlight).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Ecliptic path overlays; seasonal visibility windows; light‑pollution masks; moon position/phase.

Common misconceptions:
“Zodiacal light is the Milky Way.” They can be confused by new observers.
