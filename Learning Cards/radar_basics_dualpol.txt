# Weather Radar: Reflectivity, Velocity, Dual-Pol
One-sentence takeaway: Radar infers hydrometeor size/phase and wind via returned power and phase information.

What it is:
• Reflectivity (Z, dBZ): target size/number.
• Velocity (V): motion along beam via Doppler shift.
• Dual-pol (ZDR, KDP, ρhv): shape, orientation, and mixed-phase clues.

How it works:
Electromagnetic pulses scatter off precipitation; dual polarization compares horizontal vs vertical returns.

Key terms:
Bright band; Beam height/earth curvature; Range folding; Ground clutter.

Typical values/units:
Light rain ~20–30 dBZ; heavy ≥40 dBZ; big hail often ≥55 dBZ; KDP >1–2 °·km⁻¹ suggests intense rain.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Hook echoes, bowing segments, differential signatures for hail (low ZDR, high Z), debris (low ρhv).

Common misconceptions:
“Radar sees the ground truth at the surface.” Beam height increases with range; blockage/bright band can mislead.
