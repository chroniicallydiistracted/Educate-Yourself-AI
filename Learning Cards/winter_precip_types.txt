# Snow, Sleet, Freezing Rain & Ratios
One-sentence takeaway: Precip type depends on the vertical temperature profile; small “warm noses” aloft can flip snow to sleet/freezing rain.

What it is:
• Snow: all subfreezing column.
• Sleet (ice pellets): melts aloft, refreezes in deep cold near surface.
• Freezing rain: melts aloft, shallow near-surface subfreezing layer → supercooled liquid freezes on contact.

How it works:
Thermal layers and depth control phase changes; snow-to-liquid ratio varies widely (not always 10:1).

Key terms:
Warm nose; Wet-bulb; Dendritic growth zone.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Dual-pol phase hints; model cross-sections; freezing rain accretion forecasts.

Common misconceptions:
“10:1 applies everywhere.” Ratios depend on temperature and microphysics.
