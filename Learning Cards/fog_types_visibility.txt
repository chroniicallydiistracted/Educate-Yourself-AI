# Fog Types & Visibility
One-sentence takeaway: Fog forms when air near the surface reaches saturation by cooling, moisture addition, or mixing.

What it is:
Radiation fog, advection fog, upslope fog, steam fog.

How it works:
Nocturnal cooling under clear, calm conditions; moist advection over cooler surfaces; orographic lift; mixing to saturation.

Key terms:
Lifting condensation level; Dew point; Visibility thresholds.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Nighttime microphysics RGB; 3.9–11 µm difference; surface obs visibility drops.

Common misconceptions:
“Fog is just low cloud.” It is a cloud at the ground, but formation pathways vary.
