# Eclipses (Solar/Lunar) & Transit Geometry
One-sentence takeaway: Precise alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth create eclipses with calculable paths, timings, and obscuration.

What it is:
Solar eclipses (Moon blocks Sun: total/annular/partial) and lunar eclipses (Earth’s shadow on Moon). Planetary transits are small bodies crossing the solar disk.

How it works:
Alignments near lunar nodes produce umbra/penumbra footprints; local contact times define event phases (C1–C4).

Key terms:
Umbra; Penumbra; Totality; Annularity; Saros series; Contact times (C1–C4).

Typical values/units:
Path widths and durations vary; totality often a few minutes at maximum.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Ground tracks; local obscuration %; contact times; safety notes for solar viewing (filters).

Common misconceptions:
“Annular equals total.” Annular leaves a bright ring (Moon smaller than Sun).
