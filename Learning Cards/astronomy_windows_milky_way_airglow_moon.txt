# Airglow‑Correct Twilight & Milky Way Windows
One-sentence takeaway: Practical skywatching windows depend on twilight class, moon altitude/phase, and seasonal Milky Way geometry.

What it is:
A planning framework that combines astronomical darkness, moonlight, and galactic center position to forecast visibility.

How it works:
Compute sun/moon elevation vs time, mask windows with solar depression < −18°, and evaluate galactic center altitude for a given observer and season.

Key terms:
Astronomical twilight; Airmass; Galactic center RA/Dec.

Typical values/units:
Windows typically a few hours per night in season; airmass increases rapidly at low altitude.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Per‑location time bars for darkness vs moon; galactic center rise/set charts; cloud cover overlays.

Common misconceptions:
“New Moon guarantees great views.” Clouds, haze, and light pollution still dominate outcomes.
