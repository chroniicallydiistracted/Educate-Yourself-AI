# Lagrange Points & Spacecraft Monitors (L1/L2)
One-sentence takeaway: Spacecraft at gravitational balance points provide upstream solar‑wind data (L1) and deep‑space observation platforms (L2).

What it is:
Stable/semistable points in the Sun–Earth system where gravitational and centrifugal forces balance.

How it works:
L1 sits between Earth and Sun for upstream monitoring; L2 lies beyond Earth on the night side, ideal for astronomy with steady thermal environment.

Key terms:
L1; L2; DSCOVR/ACE/SOHO (L1); JWST (L2).

Typical values/units:
Distance ~1.5 million km from Earth for L1/L2.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Diagrams showing L1/L2 positions; data latency context (solar wind travel time tens of minutes).

Common misconceptions:
“Lagrange points are stationary points in space.” They co‑rotate with the Earth–Sun system; spacecraft use halo/Lissajous orbits.
