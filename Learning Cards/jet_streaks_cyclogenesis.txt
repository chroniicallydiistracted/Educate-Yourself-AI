# Jet Streaks & Cyclogenesis
One-sentence takeaway: Local maxima in jet speed (streaks) create ageostrophic circulations that favor rising/sinking motion and storm development.

What it is:
Dynamics within the larger jet stream.

How it works:
Left-exit/right-entrance regions promote upper divergence → surface pressure falls; opposite quadrants favor subsidence.

Key terms:
Divergence/convergence aloft; Q-vector; Potential vorticity (PV).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
200–300 hPa isotachs; water-vapor dry slots; surface cyclogenesis.

Common misconceptions:
“Stronger jet always means stronger surface wind.” Location relative to streak quadrants matters more.
