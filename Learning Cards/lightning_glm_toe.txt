# Lightning Basics & GLM/TOE
One-sentence takeaway: Lightning is a rapid electrical discharge; GOES-R GLM detects optical flashes, enabling gridded energy metrics like TOE.

What it is:
Cloud-to-ground and intra-cloud discharges; GLM measures transient optical events from geostationary orbit.

How it works:
Charge separation in storms → breakdown; GLM clusters optical events into groups/flashes; TOE (Total Optical Energy) sums radiance over a grid/time window, approximating lightning activity density/intensity.

Key terms:
GLM event/group/flash; TOE; Detection efficiency; Parallax.

Typical values/units:
GLM nominal pixel size ~8–14 km (nadir to limb); TOE is an instrument-specific radiance sum over space/time windows.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Heatmap of TOE or flash-density; rapid increases (“lightning jumps”) may precede intensification.

Common misconceptions:
“GLM sees every strike.” It detects optical signatures; viewing geometry, clouds, and daytime background affect detection.
