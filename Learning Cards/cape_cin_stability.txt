# CAPE, CIN & Atmospheric Stability
One-sentence takeaway: CAPE measures buoyant energy for updrafts; CIN measures the energy barrier to initiation; lapse rates describe the stratification.

What it is:
Thermodynamic metrics from a vertical sounding.

How it works:
Parcels lifted dry-adiabatically to the LCL, then moist-adiabatically; integrate positive (CAPE) and negative (CIN) buoyancy areas.

Key terms:
Dry adiabatic lapse rate ≈ 9.8 °C·km⁻¹; Moist adiabatic ≈ ~4–7 °C·km⁻¹; LCL, LFC, EL.

Typical values/units:
CAPE J·kg⁻¹ (hundreds to several thousand); CIN J·kg⁻¹ (tens–hundreds).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
CAPE/CIN analyses; steep mid-level lapse rates favor large hail; capping inversions delay initiation.

Common misconceptions:
“High CAPE guarantees storms.” You still need lift and sufficient moisture; CIN can suppress storms.
