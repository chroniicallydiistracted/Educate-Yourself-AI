# Substorms & Auroral Dynamics
One-sentence takeaway: Short, explosive energy releases in the magnetotail rapidly intensify and reshape aurora.

What it is:
A three‑phase process (growth, expansion, recovery) involving tail reconnection and auroral brightening/poleward expansion.

How it works:
Energy stored in the magnetotail is released, driving particle injections and enhanced ionospheric currents (AE/AL spikes).

Key terms:
Pi2 pulsations; Electrojet; Injection; Pseudobreakup.

Typical values/units:
Durations tens of minutes to a few hours; AE can exceed 1000 nT during active phases.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Keograms/time‑height summaries; oval expansion; AL/AE indices; westward traveling surges.

Common misconceptions:
“Substorm equals geomagnetic storm.” Substorms can occur without major global storms.
