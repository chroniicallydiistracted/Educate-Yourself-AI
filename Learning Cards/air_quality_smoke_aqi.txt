# Air Quality, Smoke & AQI
One-sentence takeaway: Fine particles and gases affect health; AQI translates concentrations into impact categories.

What it is:
PM₂.₅/PM₁₀, ozone, NO₂, SO₂, CO.

How it works:
Emissions + chemistry + meteorology (stagnation/inversions) control concentrations; smoke plumes travel long distances.

Key terms:
PM₂.₅ (µg·m⁻³); AQI categories: Good (0–50), Moderate (51–100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101–150), Unhealthy (151–200), Very Unhealthy (201–300), Hazardous (301–500).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Aerosol optical depth; surface PM; smoke plume detection in satellite (VIS/IR).

Common misconceptions:
“Smoke is just a local issue.” Transport and lofting can affect distant regions.
