# Proton Events & Polar Cap Absorption (PCA)
One-sentence takeaway: Solar energetic proton events increase ionization at high latitudes, degrading HF comms via polar cap absorption.

What it is:
Elevated fluxes of >10 MeV protons from solar eruptions; operationally categorized (S‑scale) by intensity.

How it works:
Protons follow magnetic field lines into polar regions, enhancing D‑region ionization and absorbing HF signals; effects can persist hours to days.

Key terms:
SEP; PCA; S‑scale (S1–S5); >10 MeV proton flux.

Typical values/units:
Thresholds for S1 start at ~10 pfu (proton flux units); stronger events reach hundreds to thousands pfu.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Polar absorption masks; proton flux timelines; warnings for polar aviation routes.

Common misconceptions:
“Only flares cause PCA.” CME‑driven particle acceleration is a frequent driver.
