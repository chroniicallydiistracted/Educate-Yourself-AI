# Cosmic Rays & Forbush Decreases
One-sentence takeaway: Galactic cosmic‑ray flux at Earth varies with solar activity; sudden drops (Forbush decreases) follow CME passages.

What it is:
High‑energy particles from outside the solar system modulated by the heliospheric magnetic field and solar wind.

How it works:
Stronger solar wind and magnetic turbulence during active periods scatter and exclude cosmic rays, reducing counts; CME‑driven disturbances cause rapid, temporary decreases measured by neutron monitors.

Key terms:
GCR; Modulation potential; Neutron monitor count rate; Forbush decrease.

Typical values/units:
Count rates are relative to station baselines; decreases a few percent to >10% during significant events.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Station time series; annotated events; correlations with Kp/Dst and CME arrivals.

Common misconceptions:
“Cosmic rays always drop during any flare.” It’s the interplanetary disturbance that drives the decrease.
