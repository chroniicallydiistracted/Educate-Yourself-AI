# Tides: Spring/Neap, Perigee Effects & Storm Surge Context
One-sentence takeaway: Astronomical tides modulate baseline sea level; phase and range can amplify or mitigate weather-driven surge.

What it is:
Semi‑diurnal/diurnal ocean tides forced by lunar/solar gravity; spring tides (new/full) have larger ranges, neap (quarter phases) smaller. Perigee increases tidal range.

How it works:
Constructive/destructive interference of tidal constituents and local resonance shape range; pairing with storm surge determines flood risk.

Key terms:
Syzygy; Tidal range; Perigean tides; Storm surge.

Typical values/units:
Tidal ranges vary by basin (cm to meters).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Tide predictions; spring/neap markers; surge model overlays; flood thresholds.

Common misconceptions:
“Supermoon alone causes flooding.” Surge, waves, and local geometry often dominate impacts.
