# Weather Fronts
One-sentence takeaway: Fronts are boundaries between contrasting air masses that focus clouds, precipitation, and rapid weather changes.

What it is:
Interfaces—cold, warm, stationary, occluded—distinguished by thermal and density gradients.

How it works:
Lifting along fronts triggers cloud/precip formation; cold fronts favor narrow, sometimes severe bands; warm fronts favor broader stratiform precipitation; occlusions occur as cold air wraps around cyclones.

Key terms:
Baroclinic zone; Frontogenesis; Dryline (moisture boundary common in Plains).

Typical values/units:
Temperature contrasts often ≥5–10 °C across fronts.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
• Radar: linear convective bands on cold fronts, wide stratiform shields on warm fronts.
• Satellite: sharp cloud edges, comma-head structures with cyclones.

Common misconceptions:
“Fronts are lines.” Operationally drawn as lines, but physically occupy zones tens to hundreds of km wide.
