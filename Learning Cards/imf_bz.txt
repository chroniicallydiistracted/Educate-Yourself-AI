# Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) & Bz
One-sentence takeaway: Sustained southward IMF Bz enhances dayside reconnection and is the single most important parameter for storm strength.

What it is:
The magnetic field embedded in the solar wind, measured at L1 and decomposed into components (Bx, By, Bz) in GSM/GSE coordinates. Bz < 0 (southward) is geoeffective.

How it works:
Southward Bz opposes Earth’s northward geomagnetic field at the dayside magnetopause, enabling magnetic reconnection and energy transfer into the magnetosphere–ionosphere system.

Key terms:
nT (nanotesla); Clock angle; Reconnection; GSM coordinates.

Typical values/units:
Bz swings from positive to negative; sustained Bz ≤ −5 to −10 nT for hours often heralds strong storms.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Real-time Bx/By/Bz and clock-angle plots; risk bars highlighting prolonged southward Bz episodes.

Common misconceptions:
“Any negative Bz triggers a big storm.” Duration and magnitude both matter, as does solar-wind speed/pressure.
