# Rock Cycle
One-sentence takeaway: Rocks transform among igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic types through melting, crystallization, weathering, lithification, and metamorphism.

What it is:
A conceptual cycle linking internal heat and surface processes.

How it works:
Magma cools → igneous; weathering/erosion → sediments → lithified into sedimentary; heat/pressure/fluids alter rocks → metamorphic; any type can be remelted or reworked.

Key terms:
Clastic; Felsic/mafic; Metamorphic grade.

Typical values/units:
Metamorphism typically at elevated P–T conditions vs surface.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Topography, geologic maps, landslide susceptibility overlays.

Common misconceptions:
“It’s a simple loop.” Paths branch and skip steps depending on environment.
