# Airglow & Mesospheric Gravity Waves
One-sentence takeaway: Natural night-sky glow and wave patterns reveal upper‑atmospheric dynamics unrelated to city lights.

What it is:
Chemiluminescent emissions (e.g., OH airglow near ~85–90 km) modulated by atmospheric gravity waves that propagate from lower levels.

How it works:
Wave breaking and ducting shape ripples/bands visible in sensitive imagery; background chemistry and tides modulate brightness.

Key terms:
OH airglow; Gravity-wave propagation; Mesospheric inversion layer.

Typical values/units:
Wave wavelengths tens to hundreds of km; phase speeds tens of m·s⁻¹.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Nighttime imagery with rippled structures; conditions favoring visibility (clear, dark, low moonlight).

Common misconceptions:
“Airglow equals aurora.” Different mechanisms: chemiluminescence vs particle precipitation.
