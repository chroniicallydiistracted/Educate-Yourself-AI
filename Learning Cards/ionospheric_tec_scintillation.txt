# Ionospheric TEC & Scintillation
One-sentence takeaway: Total Electron Content (TEC) controls GPS signal delay; small‑scale irregularities cause scintillation and outages.

What it is:
Column-integrated electron density (TECU = 10¹⁶ electrons·m⁻²) and rapid amplitude/phase fluctuations (scintillation) that degrade radio links.

How it works:
Solar EUV and geomagnetic forcing set background TEC; traveling disturbances and equatorial spread‑F create irregularities that scatter radio waves, increasing errors or loss of lock.

Key terms:
TECU; foF2; ROTI; S4 index; Phase scintillation (σφ).

Typical values/units:
Mid‑latitude TEC typically ~5–30 TECU; equatorial anomaly regions can exceed 50+ TECU.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Global/continental TEC maps; ROTI/scintillation hotspots; day–night and storm‑time asymmetries.

Common misconceptions:
“High TEC always means bad GPS.” High, smooth TEC mainly adds delay; irregularities drive outages.
