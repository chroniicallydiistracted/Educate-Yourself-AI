# Planetary Waves & Quasi‑Biennial Oscillation (QBO) (Concept)
One-sentence takeaway: Alternating easterly/westerly winds in the tropical stratosphere modulate global circulation and can nudge seasonal patterns.

What it is:
A ~28‑month oscillation of equatorial stratospheric winds (QBO) interacting with planetary waves and affecting downstream weather probabilities.

How it works:
Wave–mean flow interactions propagate shear zones downward; phase influences vertical coupling and teleconnections in the extratropics.

Key terms:
QBO‑E/QBO‑W; 30 hPa index; Stratosphere–troposphere coupling.

Typical values/units:
Phase durations months to a couple of years; indices in m·s⁻¹ at standard levels (e.g., 30 hPa).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
QBO phase timelines; conceptual impact panels on jet latitude/storm tracks.

Common misconceptions:
“QBO predicts specific storms.” It modulates probabilities, not deterministic events.
