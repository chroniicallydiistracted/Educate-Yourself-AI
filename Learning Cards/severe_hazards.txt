# Severe Convective Hazards (Tornado, Hail, Wind)
One-sentence takeaway: Severe storms produce destructive winds, large hail, and tornadoes when instability and wind shear align.

What it is:
• Tornado: rapidly rotating column of air in contact with ground.
• Hail: ice stones from strong updrafts.
• Severe wind: damaging downdrafts/outflow.

How it works:
Deep shear organizes storms (supercells/squall lines); rear-flank downdrafts, mesocyclones, and cold pools modulate hazard type.

Key terms:
Hook echo; Debris ball; BWER; RFD/FFD; Bow echo; Rear-inflow jet.

Typical values/units:
Severe hail ≥1 inch (US); severe wind ≥58 mph.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Radar: TVS/velocity couplets, CC drop for debris, high ZDR columns; satellite: overshooting tops, cold-U patterns; GLM: flash rates.

Common misconceptions:
“High dBZ always means tornado.” Tornado detection relies on velocity/dual-pol and corroborating signatures.
