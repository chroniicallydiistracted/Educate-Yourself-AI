# Solar Flares & Space Weather
One-sentence takeaway: Explosive solar events emit radiation and particles that can disturb Earth’s upper atmosphere, communications, and power systems.

What it is:
Flares (electromagnetic bursts) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs: plasma/magnetic clouds) drive geomagnetic storms.

How it works:
X-ray/UV from flares ionizes the ionosphere; CMEs compress the magnetosphere; geomagnetic activity enhances auroras, can induce currents in long conductors.

Key terms:
Solar wind; CME; Geomagnetic storm; Kp index; Auroral oval.

Typical values/units:
Kp 0–9 index for global geomagnetic activity.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Auroral probability overlays; ionospheric disturbance indices.

Common misconceptions:
“Flares and CMEs are the same.” They’re related but distinct phenomena.
