# Drought, Heat & Wet-Bulb Temperature
One-sentence takeaway: Prolonged moisture deficits and heat waves stress ecosystems and people; wet-bulb temperature gauges heat stress under humidity.

What it is:
Drought indices (e.g., SPI, PDSI), soil-moisture anomalies; wet-bulb combines temperature and humidity.

How it works:
High pressure, subsidence, and feedbacks (dry soils → less evaporative cooling) amplify heat; wet-bulb near ~35 °C approaches human survivability limits for sustained exposure.

Key terms:
Heat index; Urban heat island; Evaporative demand.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Temperature anomalies, soil-moisture deficits, evapotranspiration demand.

Common misconceptions:
“Low humidity always safer.” Extreme heat with dry air still dangerous.
