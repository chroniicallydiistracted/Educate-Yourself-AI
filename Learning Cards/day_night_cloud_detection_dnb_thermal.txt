# Day–Night Cloud Detection (DNB & Thermal Differencing)
One-sentence takeaway: Night cloud detection relies on moonlight‑sensitive visible bands and thermal IR differences rather than daytime reflectance.

What it is:
Techniques using low‑light visible sensors (e.g., Day/Night Band) and thermal split‑window differences (e.g., 3.9–11 µm) to identify fog/low cloud at night.

How it works:
Under moonlight, DNB captures reflected light from clouds; thermal differences exploit emissivity/temperature contrasts between cloud and surface.

Key terms:
Day/Night Band (DNB); Split‑window; Nighttime microphysics RGB.

Typical values/units:
Signal depends on lunar phase/angle; thermal difference thresholds are sensor‑dependent.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Fog/low cloud detection composites; confidence masks; lunar illumination overlays.

Common misconceptions:
“If it’s dark, satellites can’t see clouds.” Low‑light sensors and thermal IR provide robust night detection.
