# Solar Wind at L1 (Speed, Density, Temperature)
One-sentence takeaway: Upstream solar-wind conditions measured near L1 determine the near-term energy input to Earth’s magnetosphere.

What it is:
Plasma parameters measured by spacecraft near the Sun–Earth L1 point (~1.5 million km upstream): bulk speed, proton density, temperature, and dynamic pressure.

How it works:
Higher speed/density/pressure increase magnetospheric compression; combined with southward IMF Bz, they drive stronger geomagnetic responses.

Key terms:
Dynamic pressure (nPa); Proton density (cm⁻³); Bulk speed (km·s⁻¹); Plasma beta.

Typical values/units:
Speed ~300–800 km·s⁻¹; density ~1–20 cm⁻³; dynamic pressure typically ~1–5 nPa.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Time series for speed/density/temperature/pressure with threshold shading; nowcast arrows indicating expected magnetospheric response.

Common misconceptions:
“High speed alone guarantees storms.” Coupling efficiency depends strongly on IMF orientation (Bz).
