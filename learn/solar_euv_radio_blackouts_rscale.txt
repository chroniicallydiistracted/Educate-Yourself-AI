# Solar EUV & Radio Blackouts (R‑Scale Concept)
One-sentence takeaway: Strong solar flares boost X‑ray/EUV output, causing short‑wave radio absorption on the dayside (radio blackouts).

What it is:
Operational categorization of HF communication impacts based on solar X‑ray flux levels (R1–R5).

How it works:
Enhanced X‑ray/EUV increases ionization in the D‑region ionosphere, absorbing HF signals and degrading GNSS accuracy on the sunlit hemisphere.

Key terms:
GOES X‑ray flux; R‑scale (R1–R5); D‑region absorption.

Typical values/units:
Impacts scale from minor (R1) to extreme (R5), generally associated with flare classes from M to large X events.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Dayside absorption masks; flare timelines; sunlit hemisphere impact shading.

Common misconceptions:
“Blackouts affect the whole Earth.” Effects are strongest on the dayside and along HF paths.
