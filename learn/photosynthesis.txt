# Photosynthesis
One-sentence takeaway: Plants, algae, and some bacteria convert CO₂ and water into sugars using light, releasing O₂.

What it is:
A biochemical process powering most food webs and drawing down atmospheric CO₂.

How it works:
Light reactions capture energy; Calvin cycle fixes carbon. Balanced reaction: 6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂.

Key terms:
Chlorophyll; Stomata; Carbon fixation.

Typical values/units:
Productivity in g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
NDVI/vegetation greenness and phenology; surface flux models.

Common misconceptions:
“Plants only take in CO₂.” They also respire, especially at night.
