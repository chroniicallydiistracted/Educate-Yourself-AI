# Thunderstorm Lifecycle & Ingredients
One-sentence takeaway: Storms grow, mature, and decay as rising moist air releases latent heat, then outflows cut off the updraft.

What it is:
The canonical cumulus → mature → dissipating stages.

How it works:
Lift + moisture + instability (CAPE) start towering cumulus; precipitation loading and downdrafts develop; gust fronts/outflow undercut updraft, ending the storm unless multicell/organized systems take over (e.g., squall lines, supercells with mesocyclones sustained by shear).

Key terms:
CAPE; CIN; LCL/LFC; Gust front; Mesocyclone; Anvil.

Typical values/units:
CAPE in J·kg⁻¹; updraft speeds ≈ √(2·CAPE).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Radar cores, overshooting tops (IR), outflow boundaries in visible imagery, lightning jumps in GLM.

Common misconceptions:
“All big reflectivity means hail.” Reflectivity depends on drop size/phase; dual-pol helps diagnose.
