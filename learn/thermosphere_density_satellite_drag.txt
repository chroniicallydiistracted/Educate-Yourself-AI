# Thermosphere Density & Satellite Drag
One-sentence takeaway: Geomagnetic heating increases thermospheric density and satellite drag, accelerating orbital decay.

What it is:
The upper-atmospheric density (roughly 150–600 km) that sets aerodynamic drag on low‑Earth‑orbit spacecraft.

How it works:
Enhanced EUV and geomagnetic energy input raise exospheric temperature, expanding the thermosphere and increasing density at a given altitude. Drag scales with density and velocity squared.

Key terms:
Ballistic coefficient; Exospheric temperature; JB2008/NRLMSISE models.

Typical values/units:
Density changes can be factors of 2–10 at LEO altitudes during storms; drag acceleration in m·s⁻² depends on spacecraft properties.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Storm-time “drag multiplier” overlays vs quiet baseline; altitude‑dependent density estimates.

Common misconceptions:
“Only very low satellites are affected.” Even ~400–500 km orbits can experience notable decay during strong storms.
