# Boundary Layer & Inversions
One-sentence takeaway: The lowest atmosphere mixes during the day and often caps with a stable inversion at night, shaping fog, pollution, and convection.

What it is:
The planetary boundary layer (PBL) responds quickly to surface heating/cooling and roughness.

How it works:
Daytime convective mixing deepens PBL; nocturnal radiative cooling creates surface inversions; synoptic subsidence can build elevated inversions (caps).

Key terms:
Mixing height; Residual layer; Stable/neutral/unstable.

Typical values/units:
Mixing depth: hundreds of meters to a few km depending on heating/terrain.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Fog/low stratus in visible/IR; trapped smoke/PM; temperature jumps across inversions in soundings.

Common misconceptions:
“Inversions only happen in winter.” They’re common year-round under clear, calm nights.
