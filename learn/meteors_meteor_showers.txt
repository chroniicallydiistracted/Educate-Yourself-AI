# Meteors & Meteor Showers (Radiants & Rates)
One-sentence takeaway: Annual meteor showers arise when Earth crosses debris streams, producing predictable radiant locations and peak rates.

What it is:
Swarms of meteoroids from parent comets/asteroids intersect Earth’s orbit; apparent origin point is the radiant in the sky.

How it works:
As Earth passes through the stream, encounter geometry and particle density set the zenithal hourly rate (ZHR). Moonlight and cloud cover reduce observed counts.

Key terms:
ZHR; Radiant RA/Dec; Parent body; Geocentric velocity.

Typical values/units:
Major showers peak ZHR from ~20 to 100+; sporadic background ~5–10/hr under dark skies.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Radiant maps; peak windows; moonlight interference index; observer‑location adjusted expectations.

Common misconceptions:
“ZHR equals what I’ll see.” ZHR assumes ideal dark, zenith radiant, and perfect conditions.
