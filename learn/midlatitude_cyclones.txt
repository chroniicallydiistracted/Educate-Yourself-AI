# Midlatitude Cyclones & Frontogenesis
One-sentence takeaway: Baroclinic waves along strong temperature gradients spawn cyclones that organize fronts and precipitation shields.

What it is:
Extratropical systems driven by horizontal temperature contrasts and jet dynamics.

How it works:
Jet-streak divergence aloft and surface frontogenesis intensify lows; warm conveyor belts feed moisture; wrap-around deformation zones create comma-head clouds.

Key terms:
QG forcing; Warm/cold conveyor belt; Deformation axis.

Typical values/units:
Central pressures often <1000 hPa in strong lows.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Comma clouds, broad stratiform rain/snow, dry slots in water-vapor imagery.

Common misconceptions:
“Only fronts cause precip.” Conveyor-belt ascent and isentropic lift are key.
