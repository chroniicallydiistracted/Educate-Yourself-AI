# Noctilucent Clouds (Polar Mesospheric Clouds)
One-sentence takeaway: Very high‑altitude ice clouds near 80–85 km appear in summer twilight at high latitudes.

What it is:
Ice particles forming near the mesopause under very low temperatures; observed as bright, wispy structures after sunset/before sunrise.

How it works:
Water vapor and condensation nuclei allow ice formation under extreme cold; mesospheric dynamics and solar activity modulate occurrence.

Key terms:
PMC; Mesopause; Solar cycle modulation.

Typical values/units:
Altitudes ~80–85 km; seasonal windows centered on local summer at high latitudes.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Probability/occurrence maps; recent observation galleries; twilight geometry aids.

Common misconceptions:
“NLCs are tropospheric clouds.” They are mesospheric and unrelated to weather clouds.
