# Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes/Typhoons)
One-sentence takeaway: Warm-core rotating storms draw energy from ocean heat and moist convection, producing extreme wind, rain, and surge.

What it is:
Named storms organized around a low-pressure center; regional naming varies (hurricane/typhoon/cyclone).

How it works:
Surface fluxes + Coriolis → rotating convection; eyewall cycles and shear modulate intensity.

Key terms:
Eye/eyewall; Rapid intensification; Storm surge; Vertical shear.

Typical values/units:
Saffir-Simpson categories by 1-min sustained wind (mph): 1: 74–95, 2: 96–110, 3: 111–129, 4: 130–156, 5: ≥157.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Tight isobars, symmetric cold tops (IR), spiral rainbands, high precip rates, coastal surge models.

Common misconceptions:
“Category tells flood risk.” Category is wind-based; rainfall/surge impacts can exceed category.
