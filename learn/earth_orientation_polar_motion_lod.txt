# Earth Orientation: Polar Motion & Length‑of‑Day (LOD)
One-sentence takeaway: Small changes in Earth’s rotation and pole position occur due to angular‑momentum exchange with atmosphere and oceans.

What it is:
Polar motion (x,y) and LOD anomalies relative to UTC; needed for precise timing and pointing systems.

How it works:
Seasonal and episodic mass/wind changes shift Earth’s rotation axis and rate. Geophysical fluids exchange angular momentum with the solid Earth.

Key terms:
AAM (atmospheric angular momentum); Chandler wobble; UT1–UTC.

Typical values/units:
LOD variations on the order of milliseconds; polar motion on the order of milliarcseconds.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
LOD anomaly timelines; polar‑motion plots; context callouts during major anomalies.

Common misconceptions:
“These changes affect daily life strongly.” Effects are tiny but important for precision applications.
