# Greenhouse Effect
One-sentence takeaway: Certain gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, warming the lower atmosphere and surface.

What it is:
A radiative property of the atmosphere involving water vapor, CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, and others.

How it works:
Sunlight (shortwave) largely passes through; the surface emits longwave IR absorbed by greenhouse gases, which re-emit in all directions, raising the effective emission height and surface temperature.

Key terms:
Radiative forcing; Longwave/shortwave; Window region; Feedback (e.g., water-vapor).

Typical values/units:
Radiation in W·m⁻²; temperature in K/°C.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
IR satellite channels (10–12 µm) show cloud-top temps; greenhouse gases not directly visible on standard weather layers but affect temperature patterns.

Common misconceptions:
“Greenhouse gases block sunlight.” They primarily interact with outgoing longwave IR, not visible light.
