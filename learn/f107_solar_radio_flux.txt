# F10.7 cm Solar Radio Flux
One-sentence takeaway: The 10.7 cm (2800 MHz) radio flux is a stable proxy for solar EUV output and overall activity.

What it is:
A daily measurement of solar radio emission at 10.7 cm wavelength. It correlates with solar EUV irradiance and thermospheric/ionospheric heating.

How it works:
Enhanced magnetic activity increases gyro-resonance and bremsstrahlung radio emissions. F10.7 tracks active regions and the solar cycle, aiding ionospheric and thermospheric models.

Key terms:
Solar flux unit (sfu = 10⁻²² W·m⁻²·Hz⁻¹); EUV; Ionospheric heating.

Typical values/units:
Quiet Sun ~65–75 sfu; active conditions often >120 sfu; values >200 sfu indicate strong activity.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Daily F10.7 plots and 81‑day running means; regime bands for low/medium/high activity; model inputs for TEC/thermosphere density.

Common misconceptions:
“F10.7 directly measures flares.” It is a broadband proxy of activity, not a flare detector.
