# Radiation Belts & Energetic Electron Flux
One-sentence takeaway: Trapped radiation in the Van Allen belts intensifies during storms, threatening satellite electronics.

What it is:
Two primary belts (inner, outer) of trapped particles, with MeV‑range electron enhancements during geomagnetic activity.

How it works:
Wave–particle interactions and injections accelerate and scatter electrons; slot region between belts can fill during strong events.

Key terms:
Van Allen belts; MeV electrons; Slot region; PSD (phase‑space density).

Typical values/units:
Fluxes reported by energy channels (keV–MeV); hazard thresholds vary by orbit and hardware tolerance.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Electron flux timelines; storm‑time enhancement flags; orbit‑dependent risk overlays.

Common misconceptions:
“All radiation effects are from protons.” Electrons are a major contributor in GEO/MEO hazards.
