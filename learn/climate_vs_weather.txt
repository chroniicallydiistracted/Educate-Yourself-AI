# Climate vs Weather
One-sentence takeaway: Weather is short-term atmospheric conditions; climate is the statistical distribution of those conditions over decades.

What it is:
Timescale distinction fundamental to interpretation.

How it works:
Climate normals typically computed over 30-year reference periods; variability and extremes are part of both but contextualized differently.

Key terms:
Climatology; Anomaly; Variability; Extremes.

Typical values/units:
Normals/percentiles; anomalies in °C, mm, etc.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Anomaly maps (temperature, precipitation), percentile ranks.

Common misconceptions:
“A cold day disproves warming.” Single events don’t describe long-term statistics.
