# Magnetopause & Bow Shock Stand‑off Distance
One-sentence takeaway: Solar‑wind pressure compresses Earth’s magnetosphere; the subsolar magnetopause distance shrinks during disturbances.

What it is:
Boundaries where the solar wind slows and diverts (bow shock) and where solar‑wind/magnetospheric pressure balance (magnetopause).

How it works:
Pressure balance sets stand‑off distances; increases in solar‑wind dynamic pressure move boundaries Earthward.

Key terms:
Subsolar magnetopause; Dynamic pressure; Shue model (concept).

Typical values/units:
Quiet subsolar magnetopause near ~10 Earth radii (Re), but variable with pressure and IMF.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Estimated stand‑off vs pressure plots; GEO orbit ring for context; alerts when compression risks GEO.

Common misconceptions:
“Distance depends only on speed.” It depends on density, speed (pressure), and IMF conditions.
