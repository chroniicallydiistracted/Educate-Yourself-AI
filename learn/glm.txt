Title: GLM TOE (Total Optical Energy) — Learning Card

Summary:
- GLM (Geostationary Lightning Mapper) detects cloud‑top optical emissions.
- TOE is the sum of optical energy within each grid cell over a time window.
- Units: femtojoules (fJ). Default window: 5 minutes (configurable).

Definitions:
- Event/Group/Flash: GLM Level‑2 provides detections at increasing aggregation scales.
- TOE: Σ(E_i) for all events within a cell during the selected window.
- ABI Fixed Grid: GOES‑R geostationary grid (~2×2 km cells) used for canonical accumulation.

Update Cadence:
- GLM L2 LCFA granules are produced about every ~20 seconds.
- Several granules per minute; server keeps a rolling window (e.g., 5 minutes).

Limitations:
- Cloud‑top parallax and geometry: apparent locations are not ground‑strike points.
- Coverage and sensitivity vary with satellite view geometry.
- Display uses colorized PNG tiles; colors represent higher TOE as warmer colors.

QC & Filters:
- Optional qc=true excludes detections with failing QC flags when available.
- LCFA may include event_quality_flag or similar; 1=good, 0=bad (heuristic).

Color Ramp (approx.):
- < 50 fJ: teal, < 200 fJ: blue, < 500 fJ: indigo, < 1000 fJ: yellow, < 2000 fJ: orange, ≥ 2000 fJ: red.

Original Sources:
- NOAA GOES‑R GLM Level‑2 (LCFA) public S3 (e.g., noaa-goes16/noaa-goes18).
- Documentation: GOES‑R Series Data Book; NOAA Open Data Registry; GLM product guides.

Operational Notes:
- The service supports deterministic tiles via t=ISO8601 and window parameters.
- A small in‑memory tile cache is enabled; proxy adds Cache‑Control for determinism.
