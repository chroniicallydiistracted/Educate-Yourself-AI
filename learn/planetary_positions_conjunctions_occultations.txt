# Planetary Positions, Conjunctions & Occultations
One-sentence takeaway: Apparent sky positions of planets follow predictable ephemerides, yielding conjunctions and occasional occultations.

What it is:
Geometric alignments as seen from Earth; elongation and opposition control visibility; occultations occur when the Moon or a planet passes in front of another.

How it works:
Orbital mechanics sets RA/Dec and altitude/azimuth vs time for any observer; conjunctions reflect small angular separations on the sky.

Key terms:
Elongation; Opposition; Conjunction; Occultation; Ephemeris.

Typical values/units:
Angular separations in degrees/arcminutes; times in UTC/local.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Sky charts with conjunction lines; horizon plots; per‑observer visibility windows.

Common misconceptions:
“Conjunctions mean close physically.” They are line‑of‑sight alignments.
