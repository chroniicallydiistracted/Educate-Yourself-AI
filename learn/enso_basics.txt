# El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
One-sentence takeaway: Periodic warming/cooling of the tropical Pacific shifts global atmospheric circulation, altering temperature and rainfall patterns.

What it is:
Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability with El Niño (warm), La Niña (cool), and neutral phases.

How it works:
Trade-wind changes affect upwelling and thermocline slope; convection relocates, shifting jet streams and storm tracks.

Key terms:
Niño 3.4 index; Walker circulation; Teleconnections.

Typical values/units:
Indices in °C anomalies; durations months to seasons.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
SST anomaly maps; shifted precipitation probabilities.

Common misconceptions:
“ENSO controls all weather.” It tilts probabilities; local factors still dominate events.
