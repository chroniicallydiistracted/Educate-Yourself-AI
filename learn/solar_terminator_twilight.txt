# Solar Terminator & Twilight Geometry
One-sentence takeaway: The Sun’s depression angle below the horizon defines civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight and controls sky brightness.

What it is:
A geometric classification of twilight by solar elevation: civil (0° to −6°), nautical (−6° to −12°), astronomical (−12° to −18°).

How it works:
As the Sun drops, scattered light diminishes; astronomical twilight ends near −18°, after which the sky is darkest under clear, moonless conditions.

Key terms:
Solar depression angle; Golden hour; Blue hour.

Typical values/units:
Angles in degrees; times depend on latitude/season.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Terminator line on maps; per‑location twilight class shading; photography windows.

Common misconceptions:
“Astronomical darkness starts at sunset.” Darkness progresses through twilight stages.
