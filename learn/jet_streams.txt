# Jet Streams
One-sentence takeaway: Narrow, fast westerly flows aloft that steer storms and modulate temperature and precipitation patterns.

What it is:
Polar and subtropical jets near the tropopause formed by thermal wind balance across strong horizontal temperature gradients.

How it works:
Jet streak entrance/exit regions create divergence/convergence aloft, encouraging cyclone growth or decay.

Key terms:
Tropopause; Thermal wind; Ageostrophic circulation; Jet streak.

Typical values/units:
Core speeds often 30–70 m·s⁻¹; altitude ~9–12 km.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
200–300 hPa wind analyses; satellite water-vapor bands tracing jet-level dynamics.

Common misconceptions:
“Jet streams are fixed.” They meander, split, and shift seasonally.
