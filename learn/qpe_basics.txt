# Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE)
One-sentence takeaway: Radar, gauges, and satellites are blended to estimate rainfall; each sensor has biases that need correction.

What it is:
Methods to convert reflectivity and other signals into rain rate and accumulations.

How it works:
Z–R relationships, dual-pol (KDP-based rain), gauge adjustment, morphing satellite IR/microwave products.

Key terms:
Bright-band bias; Beam overshoot; Gauge undercatch.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Accumulation mosaics; uncertainty in complex terrain or far from radars.

Common misconceptions:
“Radar totals are exact.” They’re estimates, improved by multi-sensor merging.
