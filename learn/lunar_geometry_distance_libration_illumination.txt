# Lunar Geometry: Distance, Libration & Illumination
One-sentence takeaway: The Moon’s distance varies (perigee/apogee), and libration reveals slightly different lunar faces; illumination sets phase.

What it is:
Orbital eccentricity changes apparent size and brightness; libration in longitude/latitude tilts the visible disk; phase is the Sun‑Moon‑Earth angle.

How it works:
Elliptical orbit and axial tilt cause cyclic distance and viewing geometry changes; illumination fraction depends on phase angle.

Key terms:
Perigee/apogee; Libration; Phase angle; Illumination %.

Typical values/units:
Distance ~356,000–406,000 km; illumination 0–100% across synodic month (~29.5 days).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Per‑date distance/phase/libration plots; “supermoon/micromoon” flags; rise/set times.

Common misconceptions:
“Supermoon drastically changes tides weather.” Tidal range changes are modest; weather impacts are indirect.
