# Carbon Cycle
One-sentence takeaway: Carbon moves among atmosphere, oceans, land biosphere, and geologic reservoirs via physical, chemical, and biological processes.

What it is:
Exchanges through photosynthesis/respiration, ocean-air fluxes, weathering, burial, and volcanic return.

How it works:
Photosynthesis fixes CO₂ into biomass; respiration and decomposition return CO₂; oceans dissolve CO₂ and store it; lithification and volcanism act on geologic timescales.

Key terms:
Net primary production (NPP); Solubility pump; Biological pump.

Typical values/units:
Fluxes reported in PgC·yr⁻¹; concentrations in ppm.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Vegetation indices (NDVI), SST patterns affecting CO₂ solubility, fire activity (emissions).

Common misconceptions:
“Forests are always carbon sinks.” Disturbance/seasonality can invert sink/source behavior.
