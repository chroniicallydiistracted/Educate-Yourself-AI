# Aurora Physics: Emission Lines & Colors
One-sentence takeaway: Auroral colors arise from specific atmospheric emissions at characteristic altitudes and particle energies.

What it is:
Visible emissions from oxygen and nitrogen excited by precipitating particles along magnetic field lines.

How it works:
Electron/proton precipitation excites species that emit at key wavelengths as they return to lower energy states—green 557.7 nm O (~100–150 km), red 630.0 nm O (~200–300 km), blue/violet bands from N₂⁺ (~427.8 nm).

Key terms:
Discrete vs diffuse aurora; Precipitating electrons/protons; Emission altitude.

Typical values/units:
Altitude bands (km); Wavelengths (nm).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Auroral oval with color legend; altitude strips; example spectra/imagery for public education.

Common misconceptions:
“All green aurora is the same height.” Heights vary with composition, energy, and local conditions.
