# Ocean Currents
One-sentence takeaway: Wind-driven and density-driven flows move heat, salt, and nutrients, strongly shaping climate.

What it is:
Surface gyres (wind/Ekman), boundary currents (e.g., Gulf Stream), and deep thermohaline circulation.

How it works:
Surface winds + Coriolis → gyres; heat/salinity changes → density gradients → deep overturning.

Key terms:
Ekman transport; Western boundary current; Upwelling; Thermohaline.

Typical values/units:
Surface speeds up to ~1–2 m·s⁻¹ in strong boundary currents.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
SST gradients; altimetry-derived eddies; ocean color (chlorophyll) indicating upwelling.

Common misconceptions:
“Currents only follow wind.” Density structure and bathymetry matter.
