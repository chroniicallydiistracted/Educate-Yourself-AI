# Hail Formation & Microphysics
One-sentence takeaway: Strong, broad updrafts loft embryos through supercooled water, growing hailstones via accretion and wet/dry growth cycles.

What it is:
Microphysical process inside vigorous convection.

How it works:
Embryos (graupel/ice) cycle through updraft; wet growth at warmer subfreezing temps yields smoother, larger stones; dry growth produces opaque layers.

Key terms:
ZDR column; Three-body scatter spike (TBSS); Freezing level.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Very high reflectivity cores, low ZDR with high Z, TBSS artifacts, strong updraft indicators in satellite (overshooting tops).

Common misconceptions:
“Big hail means tornado.” They can co-occur but involve different dynamics.
