# Night‑Sky Brightness & Light Pollution
One-sentence takeaway: Sky brightness from artificial lights and the Moon sets the visibility of faint celestial features.

What it is:
Measures of radiance/magnitude that quantify sky glow; Bortle classes summarize observing conditions.

How it works:
Upward‑scattered light and atmospheric aerosols raise background brightness; moon phase and altitude add natural light.

Key terms:
VIIRS DNB radiance; mag·arcsec⁻²; Bortle scale.

Typical values/units:
Dark‑sky sites ~21–22 mag·arcsec⁻²; urban cores <18 mag·arcsec⁻² (brighter).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Radiance maps; Bortle approximations; moonlight masks; cloud overlays.

Common misconceptions:
“Clouds always harm observations equally.” Clouds can reflect city light and worsen urban glow more than rural sites.
