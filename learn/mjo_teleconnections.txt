# Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) & Teleconnections
One-sentence takeaway: A 30–60-day tropical disturbance propagates eastward, modulating convection and influencing midlatitude weather.

What it is:
Large-scale envelope of enhanced/suppressed tropical rainfall.

How it works:
Convective coupling with equatorial waves affects jet streams and storm tracks downstream.

Key terms:
RMM phases; Intraseasonal variability.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies; phase-dependent pattern shifts.

Common misconceptions:
“MJO predicts exact storms.” It shifts odds over weeks, not deterministic daily forecasts.

Related topics:
ENSO; Subseasonal outlooks.
