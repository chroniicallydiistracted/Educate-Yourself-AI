# Plate Tectonics
One-sentence takeaway: Earth’s rigid lithosphere is fragmented into plates that move atop the ductile asthenosphere, building mountains, quakes, and volcanoes.

What it is:
The unifying theory explaining crustal motion via divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries.

How it works:
Mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push drive plate motions. Interactions at boundaries form mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, volcanic arcs, rifts, and transform faults.

Key terms:
Lithosphere; Asthenosphere; Subduction; Rift; Accretionary prism; Benioff zone.

Typical values/units:
Plate speeds: mm/yr to cm/yr scale.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Seismicity belts, volcanic arcs, topography/bathymetry ridges/trenches; gravity anomalies.

Common misconceptions:
“Continents plow through oceanic crust.” In reality, whole plates move; oceanic crust is created/destroyed, continental is long-lived.
