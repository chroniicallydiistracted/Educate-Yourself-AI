# Fire Weather Basics
One-sentence takeaway: Hot, dry, and windy conditions with receptive fuels drive rapid wildfire spread; terrain and stability modulate behavior.

What it is:
Meteorological and fuel factors influencing ignition/spread.

How it works:
Low humidity and high winds increase evaporation/oxygen supply; unstable layers and downslope winds accelerate spread; dry thunderstorms add ignition via lightning.

Key terms:
Red Flag conditions; Haines Index; Foehn/downslope winds.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Hot spots in 3.9 µm IR; smoke plumes; low RH/high wind overlays; GLM lightning over dry areas.

Common misconceptions:
“Calm nights are safe.” Nighttime inversions can trap smoke and then break with morning winds.
