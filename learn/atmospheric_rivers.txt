# Atmospheric Rivers (ARs)
One-sentence takeaway: Long, narrow corridors of concentrated water-vapor transport deliver extreme precipitation, especially to west-coast mountains.

What it is:
High integrated vapor transport (IVT) plumes, often tied to midlatitude cyclones.

How it works:
Moisture convergence + orographic lift → heavy precipitation; AR strength graded by IVT and duration.

Key terms:
IVT (kg·m⁻¹·s⁻¹); Orographic enhancement; Pineapple Express (colloquial subset).

Typical values/units:
Strong ARs often IVT >500–700 kg·m⁻¹·s⁻¹.

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Water-vapor imagery; IVT analyses; snowline rising with warm ARs.

Common misconceptions:
“All ARs are floods.” Impact depends on soil, freezing level, duration, and terrain.
