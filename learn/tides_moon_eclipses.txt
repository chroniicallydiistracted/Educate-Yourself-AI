# Tides, Moon Phases & Eclipses
One-sentence takeaway: Lunar/solar gravity drives ocean tides; the Moon’s synodic cycle sets phases; alignments produce eclipses.

What it is:
Spring/neap tides, the ~29.5-day lunar phase cycle, solar/lunar eclipses (geometry dependent).

How it works:
Tidal bulges track gravitational potential; phase depends on Sun–Earth–Moon angle; eclipses require near-nodal alignments.

Key terms:
Perigee/apogee; Umbra/penumbra; Saros (eclipse periodicity).

What you’ll see on maps/layers:
Tide predictions; lunar position/phase overlays; eclipse ground tracks.

Common misconceptions:
“Full Moon causes big tides by itself.” Spring tides require Sun and Moon alignment (new/full), plus local factors.
